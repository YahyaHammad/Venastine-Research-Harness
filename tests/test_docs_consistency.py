"""
test_docs_consistency.py

The documented test count has drifted three times now -- §14 left it
stale, §19 corrected it by hand, and the §19-§20 review corrected it by
hand again. TECHNICAL_DEBT.md lists "run the doc cross-check every section
landing" as standing practice, which is the same instruction that has
already been forgotten twice.

This retires the class mechanically instead. Two tiers, because they need
different things to be true:

  1. The three docs agree WITH EACH OTHER. Pure text, no session state, so
     it runs under any invocation -- including `pytest tests/test_foo.py`
     while you are mid-change.
  2. That number is the REAL one. Needs the collected total, which only
     exists on an unfiltered run, so it skips when the invocation narrowed
     rather than failing on a legitimately smaller session.

Deliberately narrow. This checks the number that has actually drifted, not
every fact in every document -- a doc-linting framework nobody asked for
would rot faster than the counts it was policing.
